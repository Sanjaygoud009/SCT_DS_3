🌳 Task 3 – Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset
This is the third task of my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.

🔹 Task Objective:
Build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

📁 Dataset:
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

File used: bank.csv

📌 What I Did:
Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas

Preprocessed the data:

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding

Converted target variable y (yes/no) to 1/0

Built a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn

Evaluated the model with:

Accuracy score

Confusion matrix

Classification report

Visualized the decision tree using Matplotlib

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Google Colab

📈 Output:
A decision tree that predicts customer response (yes or no) to a marketing campaign, based on features like age, job type, education, balance, and more.
